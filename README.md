Part1:
    - Very clean code, and great use of numpy.
    - It seems like you forgot to plot the matrix. It's 2 lines that uses plt. I have added them, and the picture looks as expected.

Part2:
    - Really good use of matplotlib and numpy. I cannot point at any redundancy in the code. Really good!
    - The plots are as expected too.
